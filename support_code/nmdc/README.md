Scripts in this folder (support_code/nmdc) are for development and running locally.  They should not be considered the "source of truth" for NMDC's workflows or metadata generation.  

Production workflows scripts source locations:
-  NOM worklfow scripts live in the EnviroMS repository
-  GC-MS metabolomics, LC-MS metabolomics, and LC-MS Lipidomics workflow scripts live in the MetaMS repository
-  Metadata generation scripts live in the mass spectrometry metadata generation repository
